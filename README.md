## MyStudy: Baoshi's study and exercise code.
I've been a C/C++ and VB developer for many years. Time changed and we have to do with colossal data in our business.
I found I am so interested in data analysis work. I picked a couple on-line courses and did some self taught.
I included exercise code here for my review later. 
* Node.JS & JavaScript
* Python
* Octave
* R
* C/C++
* Java
 
Since Auguest 2015, I've been planning some IoT & Cloud product. I got involved in Androidd, Arduino and BigData technology. Also put in the lab code.
* Android
* Arduino
* CloudAPP & CloudComputing

The courses I took include:
* Machine Learning [by Andrew Ng from Stanford]
* Practical Machine Learning Series [by Jeff Leek, PhD, Roger D. Peng, PhD, Brian Caffo, PhD from Johns Hopkins]
* Cloud Computing [by Indranil Gupta from Illinois]
* Cloud Computing Applications [by Roy H. Campbell, Reza Farivar, PhD]
* Programming for Everybody (Python) [by Charles Severance from Michigan]
* Programming Mobile Applications for Android Handheld Systems [by Dr. Adam Porter from Maryland]
* etc.
