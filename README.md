## MyStudy: Baoshi's study and exercise code.
I've been a C/C++ and VB developer for many years. Time changed and we have to do with colossal data in our business.
I found I am so intered in data analysis work. I picked a couple online courses and did some self taught.
I included exercise code here for my review later.
* Node.js & Javascript
* Python
* Octave
* R

The courses I took include:
* Machine Learning [by Andrew Ng from Stanford]
* Practical Machine Learning [by Jeff Leek, PhD, Roger D. Peng, PhD, Brian Caffo, PhD from Johns Hopkins]
* Cloud Computing [by Indranil Gupta from Illinois]
* Programming for Everybody (Python) [by Charles Severance from Michigan]
* etc.
