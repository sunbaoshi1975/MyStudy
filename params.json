Time changed and we have to do with colossal data in our business.\r\nI found I am so interested in data analysis work. I took a few on-line courses and did some self taught.\r\nI included exercise code here for my review later. Particularly, refer to my [Datascience Coursera](http://sunbaoshi1975.github.io/datasciencecoursera/) repository for field assignments.\r\n* Node.JS & JavaScript\r\n* Python\r\n* Octave\r\n* R\r\n\r\nThe courses I'm taking or finished include:\r\n* Machine Learning [by Andrew Ng from Stanford]\r\n* Practical Machine Learning [by Jeff Leek, PhD, Roger D. Peng, PhD, Brian Caffo, PhD from Johns Hopkins]\r\n* Cloud Computing [by Indranil Gupta from Illinois]\r\n* Programming for Everybody (Python) [by Charles Severance from Michigan]\r\n* R Programming [by Roger D.
